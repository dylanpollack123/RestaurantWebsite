# RestaurantWebsite

This is a website for a fake restaurant that I created to display to my HTML and CSS skills in a unique and interesting manner. The website contains five pages that users can navigate through with a dropdown navigation bar by using the toggle menu. This is the first website I have created and I plan to create more websites of all different types in the future!
